# Dave's Dotfiles

Simple set of scripts put in place to allow me to quickly configure a machine to get it up and running from a fresh install pretty quickly. It does a couple of things for me:

1. Installs Apple's Command Line Tools
2. Sets Various OS X Settings for me
3. Cleans up the OS X Dock (by purging ALL the folders)
4. Installs HomeBrew from http://brew.sh
5. Installs/Updates various OS X copies of command line tools to ensure they're up to date
6. Installs Oh My Zsh from http://ohmyz.sh
7. Installs rbenv
8. Installs an up to date version of ruby (currently 2.1.5)
9. Installs PHP 5.4 from http://php-osx.liip.ch/
10. Puts Aliases of all the dotfiles contained within this repository in place

## Setup

CopyPasta this command into your terminal

```
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidturner/dotfiles/master/install.sh`"
```

Simples.

## Questions? Help? OH MY GOD IT BROKE ALL THE THINGS HELP ME!!!!

Get in touch, open an issue, and I'll do what I can to help but this is pretty much an "as is" package built for my needs. I've found it to be a pretty reliable bit of code but your mileage may vary.
